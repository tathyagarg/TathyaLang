# TathyaLang

My custom language that I made because everybody needs their own programming language (obviously). I made it in the Rust Programming Language as I wanted to try something new (I barely know rust).
No it doesn't have a logo yet (it doesn't need one).

## Discontinued (I don't understand rust) (Maybe I'll give it a go in rust again later on)
Using python to rewrite it
